A bioinformatics library written in Rust.

This is not meant to compare with the current bioinformatics library (https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio). I have only ever used Biopython and never rust-bio but it is undoubtedly great.

This is just a fun, toy thing that I am using to learn more about rust and extend my knowledge of what goes on under the hood of a bioinformatics library. Changes will be slow as I have little time to work on this side project. I also highly doubt anyone will read this anyway, but may as well have it.
